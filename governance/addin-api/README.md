# Governance Addin Api

The addin API is for customising the governance structure of your DAO with plugins. 
For example: 
* Use [NFTs](https://docs.realms.today/DAO-Management/createing-DAOs/NFT-Community-DAO) as governance power.
* Use time locked tokens (Vote Escrowed Tokens aka. veTokens) .
* Any custom logic you can think about.

NFT governance and locker are the two officially supported ones which can be set through proposals.
