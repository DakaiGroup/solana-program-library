# Governance Addin Api

The addin API is for customising the governance structure of your DAO with plugins. 
For example: 
* Use [NFTs](https://docs.realms.today/DAO-Management/createing-DAOs/NFT-Community-DAO) as [governance power](https://github.com/solana-labs/governance-program-library/tree/master/programs/nft-voter)
* Use [time locked tokens](https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/voter-stake-registry) (Vote Escrowed Tokens aka. veTokens)
* Any custom logic you can think about

NFT governance and locker are the two officially supported ones which can be set through proposals.
